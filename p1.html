        Description by Alex

      <p>
    
This object was given to me by my grandma before she passed away. it was a meaningful piece of jewelry that meant a lot to her. it was a gold circular accessory enclosed by tiny diamonds between two silver bands.      </p>

        Design Process

      <p>
     In order to easily build it in the P5. I first created the base with basic circles and duplicate it to make it looks like has more "depth". However, I found out that it lacks diversity so I substitute the bottom of the base with a nice square I found in Reference. I had some difficulties building the tiny diamonds. I first built my base in the middle of the canvas however it's tricky to make the little diamonds that follow the outline of my base. My resolution is to rebuild the whole jewelry in the (0,0) position. and then use code:   translate(width/_, height/_); to make the whole object in the center! The solution worked and make my code looked cleaner and simple. To finish the project, I added a star shape that I found in Reference at the center as an additional detail.

      <p>
        I think the difference between writing description to coding is how limited it is but also how many possibilities you can see. With limited words, I'm not sure the exact color of the jewelry, and also by the limited of my coding skill, I tend to build a simple image from it. I  translate Alex's writing into images in my mind and then translate it again into code. I think the image must be very different from Alex's mind cause it went through two times of transformation. I think it's the most interesting part of this project. Also, I found out that coding is actually like building design through Adobe Illustrator. shape and create and name each layer/code
with a clear name. For the person who only uses PS and Ai and first-time coding, I found it's not especially hard to translate those processes into P5.
