      <p>
During the process of learning API, I felt extremely uncomfortable seeing all my data being present in digital format. Those formats are a  part of me and can retain on the internet forever. Learning how to READ the JSON, I feel my existence has been watched by the higher power and make me question myself: am I safe? am I an individual or just these numbers? 
           <p>

So for my sousveillance tool, I wanna make a visual metaphor to recreate the feeling of me as a citizen being sousveillance by the government.
           <p>

I visualized the weather data where I live, and the position of the image will follow by the mouse, also combine the camera present myself in pixel format.
Once my mouse and my data are aligned, all the images will disappear. This is what I feel as being a citizen watcher.

      <p>

As for the final project, I try to combine all the skills I learned through the semester. I personally like the mouse function and the camera function a lot and I would like to explore it with API.

Based on this reason, first I do the data visualization based on a relatively simple API to avoid overwhelmed design. I choose OpenWeather's current weather data and visualized the humidity level and temperature.
           <p>

Once finished the visualized data, I make the data interactable by using the mouse function to change position. The data will follow the mouse changing position and align together to form a circle when you move them into a certain position.
           <p>

I also add the camera function as a background design to create a more interactable feeling of being sousveillance.

In the final, I  choose to use mouse control to change the color create the disappear effect when the mouse and data altogether.    </p>
      <p>
    Through the semester, I learned that writing code is always not my most comfortable format of art, however, for the final project, I decided to create a piece using what I can do/what I learned and combine my favorite function together, I think my project involve through the progress and at the end, I am able to convey my feelings(slightly) using what I can do.
