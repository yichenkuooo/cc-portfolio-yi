I think the concept of watches/clocks always gives me a nostalgic feeling. I only wear watches or watch clocks when I was little. When I grow up, I almost rely on the numbers on computers or phones to understand the concept of time. So I wanted to bring this feeling of nostalgia to my work—I grew up in the early 2000s when there was a watch that glowed in the dark. I had to put my hand on the watch and cover the light to see the time. At that time, I felt that is the coolest invention in the world. Now I realize it's cool because that I can choose not to see the time when I open my eye, and only when I cover my eyes can I see the non-light time in the dark.

My initial sketch drew the most traditional, fluorescent watch based on my memory, which has a long pointer corresponding to the time, but I want to improve it with the skills I learned in the code.

So for the second sketch, I modified the long pointer to create a more minimalist and modern surface. I drew a circle that was completed each second, and I chose not to fill in the color to create a line that gets longer every second, adding a sense of mechanics feelings.

In the last sketch, I added watch straps and fluorescent functions. What I think is very interesting is that the switch function taught in this chapter can perfectly create a fluorescent effect — when I cover the mouse (representing my hand) on the watch, the pointer will show, presenting the watch in my memory.

       I think making this watch makes me reflect on the concept of time. We only know the concept of timing when we see a clock or a number. So I want to bring this abstract, unobvious concept into my work. Only by tapping into the watch can you see the time, and the time is expressed with geometric lines, making the process of seeing time more difficult. the person who only uses PS and Ai and first-time coding, I found it's not especially hard to translate those processes into P5.
