       Body Sketch by Hector and Leg by Ying
Hector created a lovely bunny bumping around searching for its body part.  And Otter is created by Ying, floating on the sea collecting its favorite shell. I have no idea what sketched I'll receive at first, so I want to create a character that can easily be adapted into different situations/scenes. Captain Hook first came to my mind. Since he already uses a hook as his hand, therefore, if the rest of his body is different it still makes sense.

      <p>
After losing his hand, unfortunately, Captain Hook lost his other body part during the fight with the evil crocodile. Now he is on a great journey searching his body and legs. However, the sea is full of mysteries and unknown, the only living creatures he encounters are Rabbit and Otter. He has no choice. Now, he is Captain Rabit Otter! But it drives him crazy so the searching is still going on...

Using the function setup is a handy tool when it comes to corporate with other coders. Take this assignment as an example, we use the function to load different imagine/sketches from other people. The system makes it easy for the coder to create a reusable system when I didn't receive others' images I can still create the movement and change the image afterward. 
All those possibilities are based on the precondition that we used the same template so everything can be combined seamlessly.
