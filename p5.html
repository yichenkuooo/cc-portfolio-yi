    The pattern I choose is "Taiwanese Decorative Tile". Taiwan received decorative tiles during the Japanese colony period. They were a costly imported product used for decorating the exteriors of the homes of the rich, showing the others that money was no object. 
    I think this kind of "in-between" trait is very intriguing. In order to translate the pattern into digital form, I simplified the tiles and tried to let go of some restrictions, change the numbers of code, and let the programming language further evolve the traditional art. I fall in love with this random process, and let the process become the result.

    1. What are some impacts and effects of translating the pattern of your choice into digital, animating form?
    <p>
    It was not until I started to create this project that I had the opportunity to analyze and take a closer look at these beautiful traditional patterns. In this project, I found that tile art is organic and yet geometrically. Traditional patterns seem sophisticated, but I disassembled the patterns into a "group" and connected the patterns on each edge, so they can easily be duplicate and reorganized.

    2. How does creating an optical illusion recontextualizes how the pattern was traditionally used & understood?
      <p>
Taiwan received decorative tiles during the Japanese colony period. They were a costly imported product used for decorating the exteriors of the homes of the rich, showing the others that money was no object. 
In the process of digitizing these patterns, I understand this idea better. Even if the loop function is used, the process of building patterns is still extremely complicated. However, once the loop is successfully made, a large number of copies can show the beauty of quantity.
