      The data I track is my iPhone screen time. I'm trying to cut down the time I use my cellphone so I think it's a great opportunity to visualize this everyday habit.
      <!-- 4. reflection -->

      <p>
      TI tracked 6 days of screen time. Each bar represents one day of data and the x(length) equals to time of day, and y(height)  equals how long do I use the phone.

      <p>
    
      In the first three days of the tracking, I found that the time I used the phone was very fixed. The peak of data usually happens at a specific time, that is, after waking up, noon, and before sleep. Through the data, I learned that my daily habits are almost very fixed and regular. Although there are some minor changes, there are still traces to follow.
      <p>
      So on the fourth day, the fourth day, in order to experiment with the changes in data, I deleted the social media apps I use most often, which is, Facebook and Instagram. Through data visualization, you can see a significant drop in the data in the fourth column of the chart. Through direct vision, I can see my changes more clearly. This is a very useful strategy for me to further maintain my habits.
