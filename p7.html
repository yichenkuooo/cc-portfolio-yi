           <p>
For my autobiographical game, I want to allow others to understand how I (as a woman) feel unsafe in everyday life— that is, when I am walking on the road alone at a certain time/place.

I think everyone has this kind of experience: when you are walking home from the subway station at night, you see a shadow of a person appearing from a distance, you will change to another sidewalk immediately and risk crossing through the middle of the road. People would rather risk being hit by a car on the road—because it feels "safer"

I think this is a very absurd experience but happens in my everyday life, all my female friends have this experience: It is safer to walk in the middle of the road than to pass by a stranger. I want to raise everyone's attention to this matter through my game.      <!-- 4. reflection -->

In the game, you will play a female, try to dodge cars and random strangers, let yourself catch Uber, and go home. In terms of game scenes, I initially chose three times/places that I thought made me dangerous: early morning, midnight, and narrow alleys. My protagonist is a young woman, and the other obstacles are men and cars and I make my scene in pixel art style in order to let the player have the feeling that real life is as strange as the game.

    First, I used the frog game as a template to make the original idea of my gray box. I change the obstacles of the car, making it move horizontally, and let the target switch among the three scenes. I experiment with the way how my character will set back to the start when they tough the car. In my final, I changed the way the obstacle moves. The obstacle, in my final, will move back and forth in the middle of the screen, which is more different from the frog game.

      <p>

For this assignment, it is my first time and attempt I had the opportunity to make a game from scratch and  I think this is an advantage and also made me encounter many challenges.
I have too many complicated game ideas that I want to add to my game, for example, sound effects, dialog boxes. I have to search for all available techniques and resources on the internet and add them to my existing code. I learned how to integrate different codes fundamentally, such as making a game interface, switching scenes, and ending the screen after the game has reached its goal. It seems simple, but I spent a lot of effort to merge the three scenarios into a viable game.     </p>
