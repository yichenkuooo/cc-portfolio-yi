In this assignment, I experiment with the different shapes and amounts of my pixel array and leave the computer to decide my final look. I think it's a very interesting way to play with pixel art and it reminds me of pop art. During the process, I create two different shapes that capture the image and it makes a dizzy feeling. So I put this further by adding the color blue and red to make the visual look like having a fake 3D visual effect.      <p>

      <p>
I had lots of fun with this assignment and also from the demonstration from the studio section, I can see the possibilities of visual capture technic and I get a chance to create mine. However, it is also a unique experience to let the code have my camera control and it makes me more aware of the setting of my phone/camera now. This time I'm actually the coder and I feel like I  have the power to control the image I collect and it makes me feel more aware now when my device is asking for my camera permission.    </p>
